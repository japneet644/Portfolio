# My Programming Portfolio

A curated collection of programming projects showcasing my skill sets, knowledge, and interests.

## Contents

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming in Python

* **PythonOOP**: A Python 3 project demonstrating object-oriented programming principles. It runs simulations of the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm to generate data for the XY model.

### 2. Deep Learning with TensorFlow

* **CNN**: A TensorFlow implementation of a conditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn and generate data for the XY model. Note: The data is not uploaded here, but can be generated using the code in the **PythonOOP** folder.

### 3. Database Management with SQL

* **SQL**: Examples of SQL queries for storing and retrieving data used in the conditional VAE model.
