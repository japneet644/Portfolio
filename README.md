# My Programming Portfolio
A collection of selected programming projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting.

## Contents
* __PythonOOP__: An object oriented programming example in Python 3 which will run simulations of the Metropolis Hashting Algorithm to generate data for XY model.
* __CNN__: A tensorflow implementation of conditional VAE to learn the data generate data for XY model (data is not uploaded here, but can be generated from the code in folder PythonOOP).
* __SQL__: Examples of executing and formulating SQL queries for storing and retrieving the data used in the CVAE model.
